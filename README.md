```

## What's included?

Basically, nothing special.

Just as follows:

- pre-filled [`pubspec.yaml`](./pubspec.yaml)
- opinionated linting/analysis rules
- [GitHub action](.github/workflows/main.yml) build for dart tests and coverage.
- my preffered `.gitignore` setup
- `feature`-based file organization in `lib/`
- state management using [Stacked State Management](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked).
